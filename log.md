# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created a product landing page in CSS and HTML, worked on functionality for the page (not aesthetics lol).

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS. Getting stuff to look aesthetically pleasing is difficult for me, but I managed to figure out how some stuff work.

### Day 2: May 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Tried to finish up on the product landing page, the CSS part. It's not coming out properly but I won't waste too much time on it or I might get stuck here.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS for the landing page, but, slowly, I will get better at it.

### Day 3: May 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I have successfully completed the tribute page.

**Thoughts** I am so proud in having completed my tribute page within a few hours with the functionality that I wanted in the page. It's a great feeling when I finished it seeing that I had struggled with the product landing page for two days.

### Day 4: May 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I started on the personal portfolio page today, I'm struggling massively on the CSS part though.

**Thoughts** I feel kinda down that I am still stuggling with CSS. I had to redo my project like three times, from scratch mind you.

### Day 5: May 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I'm still struggling with the personal portfolio page, moreso with the CSS bit.

**Thoughts** I hope that I'll start getting this CSS stuff sooner. I decided to make a bet with my brother today: if I have not mastered how to do basic website designing by next week Wednesday, I'll owe him $50. I need all the motivation I can get right now.

### Day 6: May 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I completed a test website, to train myself more in html and css

**Thoughts** I created for pages that you can navigate to: home, about, services and contacts. I did different styling not only to the text but also to the divs (different sections of the page). It's more of a rough work but I'm proud of the work I accomplished today. I also learn how to host on netlify.

### Day 8: May 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I added more css to my page, though I did not het to where I was hoping to be at the end of the day.

**Thoughts** I revisited the product landing page that was giving me a hard tie last week. I started afresh, I'm not done yet with it.

### Day 9: May 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I decided to take time off today from my projects, and instead create fun stuff with html and css

**Thoughts** I created some animation with css and html but more of css than html. Taking a break from my projects was just what I needed to decompress.

### Day 10: May 31, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I had laptop issues today, I couldn't manae to code.

**Thoughts** I skipped a day today, I hope this doesn't happen again

**Today's Progress**: I have managed to get my product landing page to where I would like it to be at the moment.
