# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created a product landing page in CSS and HTML, worked on functionality for the page (not aesthetics lol).

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS. Getting stuff to look aesthetically pleasing is difficult for me, but I managed to figure out how some stuff work.

### Day 2: May 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Tried to finish up on the product landing page, the CSS part. It's not coming out properly but I won't waste too much time on it or I might get stuck here.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS for the landing page, but, slowly, I will get better at it.

### Day 3: May 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I have successfully completed the tribute page.

**Thoughts** I am so proud in having completed my tribute page within a few hours with the functionality that I wanted in the page. It's a great feeling when I finished it seeing that I had struggled with the product landing page for two days.

### Day 4: May 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I started on the personal portfolio page today, I'm struggling massively on the CSS part though.

**Thoughts** I feel kinda down that I am still stuggling with CSS. I had to redo my project like three times, from scratch mind you.

### Day 5: May 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I'm still struggling with the personal portfolio page, moreso with the CSS bit.

**Thoughts** I hope that I'll start getting this CSS stuff sooner. I decided to make a bet with my brother today: if I have not mastered how to do basic website designing by next week Wednesday, I'll owe him $50. I need all the motivation I can get right now.
