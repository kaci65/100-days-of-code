# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created a product landing page in CSS and HTML, worked on functionality for the page (not aesthetics lol).

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS. Getting stuff to look aesthetically pleasing is difficult for me, but I managed to figure out how some stuff work.

### Day 2: May 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Tried to finish up on the product landing page, the CSS part. It's not coming out properly but I won't waste too much time on it or I might get stuck here.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS for the landing page, but, slowly, I will get better at it.

### Day 3: May 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I have completed the tribute page.

**Thoughts** I have completed the tribute page but I have failed to pass all the checks required by FCC.

### Day 4: May 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I started on the personal portfolio page today, I'm struggling massively on the CSS part though.

**Thoughts** I feel kinda down that I am still stuggling with CSS. I had to redo my project like three times, from scratch mind you.

### Day 5: May 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I'm still struggling with the personal portfolio page, moreso with the CSS bit.

**Thoughts** I hope that I'll start getting this CSS stuff sooner. I decided to make a bet with my brother today: if I have not mastered how to do basic website designing by next week Wednesday, I'll owe him $50. I need all the motivation I can get right now.

### Day 6: May 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I completed a test website, to train myself more in html and css

**Thoughts** I created for pages that you can navigate to: home, about, services and contacts. I did different styling not only to the text but also to the divs (different sections of the page). It's more of a rough work but I'm proud of the work I accomplished today. I also learn how to host on netlify.

### Day 7: May 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I decided to gett the book, Get Coding by Young Rewired State.

**Thoughts** I have managed to do a bit today in going through the book and creating dummy pages as per the exercises of the book.

### Day 8: May 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I added more css to my page, though I did not get to where I was hoping to be at the end of the day.

**Thoughts** I revisited the product landing page that was giving me a hard tie last week. I started afresh, I'm not done yet with it.

### Day 9: May 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I decided to take time off today from my projects, and instead create fun stuff with html and css

**Thoughts** I created some animation with css and html but more of css than html, a running man with a complete background image and moving motions of the running man. Taking a break from my projects was just what I needed to decompress and reset my mind.

### Day 10: May 31, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I had laptop issues today, I couldn't manage to code.

**Thoughts** I skipped a day today, I hope this doesn't happen again

**Link(s) to work**: [Free Day] ()


### Day 11: June 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I have managed to get my product landing page to where I would like it to be at the moment (I redid everything, with the new html and css having a name of home).

**Thoughts** The progress of the product landing page has gone well today, though the navbar had given me some problems earlier in the day.

### Day 12: June 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I have managed to create a technical documentation page.

**Thoughts** The @media styling part of css is kinda confusing to me, but without it my page looks kinda funny. I'll try to figure it out though and try and understand it better.

### Day 13: June 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I created a flip card today.

**Thoughts** Using CSS to make the motions of flipping a card happen was interesting. I chose this project because I want to get good at css.

### Day 14: June 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I decided to recreate the conquer website: https://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page196/conquer.

**Thoughts** Today was interesting majorly because the challenge is to use no bootstrap to remake the above website but still make it responsive. I've been all over the place, googling, stack overflow, w3 schools, treehouse... basically everywhere. It took me long time to get the navbar to even look as it does right now, but the height still doesn't look good. This is hard work, but rewarding at the same time.

### Day 15: June 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I'm continuing where I left off yesterday, remake of the conquer website: https://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page196/conquer.

**Thoughts** I code my code lines tangled and I'm upto my neck trying to untangle everything. This sure is a lesson learnt, to be neat and organised from the word go. It will sure save me grief in the future! Now back to untangling lol

### Day 16: June 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I am done with the remake of the conquer website: https://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page196/conquer.

**Thoughts** I feel like moonwalking... maybe I will after typinh this! The website has come out looking good, no bootstrap or JS has been used,just HTML and CSS. I'm proud of the work I have accomplished today, yay!!! The responsiveness is not 100% percent there though lol. Oh, and btw, I managed to organise my code, it looks more neat now.

### Day 17: June 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I have completed Mission 2: Create a Password from the book Get Coding by Young Rewired State (https://www.amazon.com/Get-Coding-Learn-JavaScript-Website/dp/076369276X/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=get+coding&qid=1591559697&s=books&sr=1-1)

**Thoughts** I had started doing some javascript about 2 months ago, but a month into it, I wasn't getting a lot of the stuff. But the notes I have gone through today plus the exercises (from the book) are simplified and easier for me to understand. Today, I have learnt about creating a password page, which is linked it to another page. Having the password verified using javascript will determine whether you can access the linked page or not.

### Day 18: June 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I decided to revisit Flexbox and CSS Grid today

**Thoughts** I noticed that I did not have a good understanding of these two, I eben rarely used them in my code, which meant that I wrote more lines than I needed to and my work ends up looking complicated. I sometimes have no idea what line does what when I look at it. Using Flexbox and CSS Grid will sure be of much help to me and my lines!

### Day 19: June 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I have managed to only write 5 lines of code on my porfolio page project

**Thoughts** I've been researching the "perfect layout and BG image" for my portfolio page, since 2pm. Nine and a half hours later, I have 20 tabs open and only 5 lines of code 😂😂😂. I tend to overthink stuff but today was on another level. I

### Day 20: June 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I redid the tribute page

**Thoughts** Although I had earlier done the tribute page (on day 3 of the challenge), it was not up to par with the FCC checklist. I decided to redo it because I want to feature some of my projects on the portfolio page that I am yet to build. I based the tribute on JRR Tolkien, I love his books!

### Day 21: June 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Survey Form (just the HTML)

**Thoughts**I chose to redo the survey form I did one and a half years ago, for the FCC curriculum. The progress has been slow but I have managed to finish the html side of things.

**Link(s) to work**: [Survey Form] (https://github.com/kaci65/projects-100-days-of-code/tree/master/survey-form-fcc)


### Day 22: June 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Survey Form (just the HTML & CSS)

**Thoughts** The CSS bit was kinda challenging but I have managed to finish this project. I'm slowly but steadily improving on the CSS bit. For a minute, I got tempted to follow a youtube tutorial, but I'm glad I didn't. I've learnt a lot today, on the coding part but also about myself. That if I just hang in there, I can do it!

### Day 23: June 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: CSS Exercises from w3schools

**Thoughts** I felt like doing exercises today to help me continue to improve in my css. It's quite amazing how much I have retained without knowing it since I started building and creating projects, and I'm glad to see that I can solve most of the exercises without requiring to do any research (google) or ask someone.

### Day 24: June 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I wasn't able to do any coding today.

**Thoughts** There was a blackout out (no electricity) for the whole day and part of the evening in the are where I live, so I didn't do any coding today.

**Link(s) to work**: [] ()


### Day 25: June 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Redoing the product landing page.

**Thoughts** The previous product landing page that I created on day one, does not pass FCC muster, so I've had to redo it. Today I have laid down the pages barebones, that is HTML. I'll start on the CSS bit tomorrow.

### Day 32: June 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started building the personal portfolio page.

**Thoughts** I kinda struggled with the css bit, to get it to look the way I wanted. I'll call it quits for today and tackle this tomorrow, with a fresh mind. I hosted it on netlify.

**Link(s) to work**: [Personal Portfolio Page] (https://t.co/jyCI8TqXLL?amp=1)

### Day 33: June 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished building the personal portfolio page.

**Thoughts** Tackling this with a fresh mind sure helped a lot! Though I am still kinda struggling with the media queries, css flexbox and grid. I decided not to use a background image in this project and I like how it looks. I have also re-edited the navbar from the product-landing-page folder, both in html and css, but the header area is still too big for me.

### Day 34: June 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Had a hard time with CSS (replicating the four card feature from), didn't finish project.

**Thoughts** Today has been kinda frustrating, one step forward two steps back! I'm trying to recreate this https://frontendmentor.io/challenges/four-card-feature-section-weK1eFYK instead I've managed to do this https://github.com/kaci65/projects-100-days-of-code/tree/master/four-card-feature instead.

### Day 35: June 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Working on recreating the google page.

**Thoughts** I'm stuck on the font awesome icons. They refuse to work, but I managed to finish the HTML part.

**Link(s) to work**: [Google Page] (https://github.com/kaci65/projects-100-days-of-code/blob/master/google-page/index.html)


### Day 36: June 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished the google page

**Thoughts** The page closely resembles the google one but not all the way. Getting the search button to fit nicely in the search box was a nightmare. It took me over an hour to get it to work (50%). I tried following some tutorials to create this part but for some reason they made my code look worse. I'm getting a little frustrated with CSS, I should get it by now.

**Today's Progress**: Traveling

**Thoughts** Traveling

### Day 38: June 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Parallax page

**Thoughts** I couldn't get the parallax effect to work!  I think I messed up my h1 headings code too, because I have to add display:absolute to get them to stay at their respective positions. I'll just leave the code as it is today because earlier on I messed my code up and I had to undo a lot of stuff. I'll look at it with fresh eyes tomorrow.

**Link(s) to work**: [Parallax Page] (https://github.com/kaci65/projects-100-days-of-code/tree/master/parallax-website)


### Day 39: June 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Parallax page

**Thoughts** I tried to troubleshoot my code from yesterday but it seemed like I made everything worse with every code revision I made. I took a break from it then decided to start a fresh. This time round, I added the images through css instead of html and it made my work a little easier. The parallax effect works! *happy jig!!!*

### Day 40: June 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Restaurant website

**Thoughts** One step forward, three steps back. I don't know how long I'm going to 'hang in there' but after yesterday's victory with the parallax web page, I thought that today would be remotely easier but it wasn't. The navbar wasn't working, the hero page was not that good. *sighs* I feel like screaming or breaking something lol

### Day 41: July 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Cafe website

**Thoughts** I decided to redo the restaurant website. I started afresh but borrowed some code from yesterday's work (the lines that were working). I had a moment where my mind went blank, as if I've never come across html and css. I decided to take a break and do some chores around the house, then went back to tackle the cafe website later on. The progress has been slow, but i am proud of the work so far.

**Link(s) to work**: [Cafe website] (https://github.com/kaci65/projects-100-days-of-code/tree/master/cafe-website)


### Day 42: July 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Cafe website

**Thoughts** I applied flexbox to the events and location part: they were side by side. I don't like how it looks though, I might change it tomorrow. The review part looks off, the center alignment doesn't work properly. Applying flexbox didn't work so instead I applied css grid and it kinda worked. The center alignment was like at 98% so I had to use margin-left to get it to a 100%. I'll  also add review stars to the review tomorrow.


**Link(s) to work**: [Cafe website] (https://compassionate-davinci-1fe0f4.netlify.app/)


### Day 43: July 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Cafe website

**Thoughts** I changed the event and location part from floating side by side to them flowing after each other. I had used flexbox yesterday but it wasn't working so I redid those two parts. Even though the review part was center aligned, I changed it to four columns instead of three. I think it looks and fits much better than it did yesterday. 

I added the review stars, I love them! The footer too. wierd thing happened with the <hr> tag: the border radius was working perfectly but after I added a gradient to the tag, it stopped working. I still don't know what the issue could be.

I added media queries but some worked while others didn't. I'm not going to spend too much time on the webpage, so I'll leave it as it is. The thing that are still a challenge to me (MEDIA QUERIES!!!), I'll learn them as I go. Overall, I'm happy with how the project turned out.

### Day 44: July 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Javascript Exercises

**Thoughts** I had a very busy day today, and I couldn't find time to sit and write some code until like an hour ago. So I decided to do some js exercises before I went to sleep. I did the exercises from w3 schools.

### Day 45: July 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Random Quote Generator (I focused majorly on js and not the css part)

**Thoughts** I have officially started creating javascript projects today, and I really enjoyed creating a random quote generator. The quote search led me to some hilarious quotes which made my evening, I couldn't help but burst into laughter. I majorly focused on the js and a few lines of html and css.

### Day 46: July 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Color Flipper - Javascript (I followed a tutorial on this: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/hone-your-javascript-skills-by-building-these-15-projects/)

**Thoughts** Since I started the #100DaysOfCode challenge, I have stayed away from tutorials but so far javascript code seems to swim in front of my eyes!
 So for the rest of this week, I'm going to follow tutorials for javascript projects and then go cold turkey from next week.
 
 I created the color flipper. I messed up my code a couple of times but I resisted the urge to look at the final code, and instead had to comb through my code to look for errors. One of them was failing to add the parenthesis to invoke the function. Before I noticed that this was the cause of my code not working, 15 minutes had already passed lol!!!

### Day 47: July 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Counter & Reviews - Javascript (I followed a tutorial on this: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/hone-your-javascript-skills-by-building-these-15-projects/)

**Thoughts** I did the counter and reviews today. Following tutorials is kinda boring for me (no offense meant). I'm not getting the rush of encountering a problem and trying to find ways to solve it, it's not stimulating enough for me. Way forward? No idea, but I'll think more on it tonight. 

I created the counter and reviews projects. The only stimulating thing that occured in both this projects is that I had syntax errors which made my code not work, so I had to inspect my work on the browser console and try to figure out which lines were causing me problems. I hostes my projects on Netlify.

### Day 48: July 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Played Javascript games Code combat and Galacticode.

**Thoughts** I played javascript games today! Code combat & Galacticode, I'm still trying to figure out the best way to practise javascript lol. I learnt some stuff while playing the javascript coding games: arrays, functions, reusing code. Though this is fun, this would be something to do on the side not as the main way to practise javascript.

### Day 49: July 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Book reading.

**Thoughts**  I started reading Eloquent Javascript by Marijn Haverbeke today. I'm at a loss to where to start on javascript. Thought maybe reading a book might help. I haven't fiished it though, probably in a week.

### Day 50: July 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects

**Thoughts** Today I worked on the palindrome checker. This was kinda confusing though I had an easy time when going through the regular expressions part (FreeCodeCamp). I'm seriously struggling to apply theory into practise.

### Day 52: July 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects

**Thoughts** Today I worked on the roman numeral converter & caesar's cipher. I'm starting to understand a little js, practising it in small chunks is helping.

### Day 53: July 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Javascript Tutorial: Navbar & Sidebar

**Thoughts** I know I said that I'm not going to do tutorials because it's really not my learning style, I decided to give them another try. These are the tutorials I'm using (from freeCodeCamp) - https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/hone-your-javascript-skills-by-building-these-15-projects/. I then tried to redo the navbars from my previous projects (add javascript code to them) but they are not working as they should. I'll try looking at them later with fresh eyes.

### Day 54: July 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Javascript Tutorial: Modal & Questions (https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/hone-your-javascript-skills-by-building-these-15-projects/)

**Thoughts** I did the modal and questions projects from the above tutorial. I actually paused the video and attempted the modal project, and my code worked! I was so happy I had to do a happy dance all over the house lol!!! I'm starting to understand how javascript works.

### Day 55: July 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Eloquent Javascript Exercise - Looping a Triangle.

**Thoughts** It took me an hour to get this right... but I still don't know where I was going wrong. I used the for loop (as hinted in the instructions) but debugging my code for an hour did not lead me to the problem in my code. I finally had to delete everything and start afresh.

### Day 56: July 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Eloquent Javascript Exercise - FizzBuzz.

**Thoughts** Attempting to solve this but my code isn't working. I'll keep at it (using if else). I think I can do this without referring to the solution.

### Day 57: July 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Eloquent Javascript Exercise - Chessboard && FizzBuzz (redo)

**Thoughts** The chessboard code displays on JS Fiddle as having opening and closing quotation marks after running the code. Had to get an extra set of eyes because I had gone over the code and couldn't see what the issue was. But still, no issue was found in my code. So I decided to use the Mozilla console and my code ran without the opening and closing quotation marks. So the code works.

I also went over the fizzbuzz code from yesterday, and the issue was that the words in the console.log were not put in strings. It was such a simple mistake which made the code not work and the debugging a real head scratcher! I guess I've learnt something from this.

### Day 58: July 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Eloquent Javascript Exercise - Minimum.

**Thoughts** I had previously used the Math.min function, and though it worked, it didn't feel right. I consulted and was reminded that the Math.min function is an internal javascript function and that I was not actually invoking my function (called min). So I revised my code, taking into account the advise given and it worked and felt also right.

### Day 59: July 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Did not code

**Thoughts** Every day I don't code feels like I'm taking time out of the #100DaysOfCode challenge. However, if the circumstances are unavoidable, that's something I have to accept and try not to beat myself up too much.

### Day 60: July 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Eloquent Javascript Exercise - Recursion.

**Thoughts** When checking if -1 was even, it returned false instead of negative num. I then remembered how organizing one's code could mean it working or not.After reorganising and placing the code that checks if a number is negative above the code that checks if a number is odd, my function worked.

### Day 61: July 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Eloquent Javascript Exercise - Bean Counting.

**Thoughts** The code is not working. I want to use my own string of words instead of console.logging them. Or maybe this is not the correct way to solve this exercise? I'll try to see if my way works first, and if it doesn't, I'll switch over to the console.log version.

### Day 62: July 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Eloquent Javascript Exercise - Bean Counting.

**Thoughts** The issues in my code were : a) calling the parameter and function instead of the function; b) declaring a string inside the function instead of inside the console.log. After I fixed these issues, my code worked like a charm lol!

### Day 63: July 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Javascript Tutorial: Menu Page (https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/hone-your-javascript-skills-by-building-these-15-projects/)

**Thoughts** I have spent over an hour and a half just debugging my code. First it a backtick issue, instead of using them, I was using single quotation marks. The next issue was, I had ommitted a period in front of a class name ("filter-btn"), the third issue was addind an 's' to signify plural where it wasn't needed. There's a fourthone which has conviniently escaped my mind. Such small stuff have really caused me a headache but I'm glad I didn't quit or copy and paste the final source code.

### Day 64: July 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Javascript Tutorial: Video & Tabs
(https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/hone-your-javascript-skills-by-building-these-15-projects/)

**Thoughts** Today was uneventful as compared to yesterday. I had very little debugging to do. Day by day, I'm getting to understand javascript lingo. It was fun building the video page and manipulating it with javascript to get it to pause and play, that was cool.

### Day 65: July 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Javascript Tutorial: Lorem Ipsum
(https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/hone-your-javascript-skills-by-building-these-15-projects/)

**Thoughts** The major key take away from today's project was that for debugging purposes, the value of an input is a string and not a number. If the color of the output is black, this denotes a string and blue, a number. You can use console.log(typeof value) to prove that the value of an input is a string and not a number.

### Day 66: July 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Eloquent Javascript Exercise - The Sum of a Range.

**Thoughts** I decided to try out the for loop, while loop and recursion methods for the sum function. I was JS Fiddle but I forgot to add a console.log to the for loop function, when I added it, the fiddle changed to another one. This is quite annoying. I wonder if there's a way to avoid this. I'll look into it tomorrow.

### Day 67: July 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Eloquent Javascript Exercise - Reverse an Array.

**Thoughts** The returned array was (["My", "is", "name", "Kaci65"]) instead of (["My", "name", "is", "Kaci65"]). I googled and learnt that the problem was that my array was an even number instead of an odd number. That subtracting 1 from my array.length before dividing by 2 would help.

### Day 68: July 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Javascript Tutorial: Slider
(https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/hone-your-javascript-skills-by-building-these-15-projects/)

**Thoughts** I created a slider/carousel today. I've always wondered how they do it on th fancy pages or tutorials, but I mostly only thought "CSS". Now I think the functinality is easier with JavaScript.

### Day 69: July 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Javascript Tutorial: Scroll Project
(https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/hone-your-javascript-skills-by-building-these-15-projects/)

**Thoughts** While I was building my personal portfolio website of the product landing page or any project that I had included a scrolling effect, it didn't always work smoothly. Today, I have learnt that I can add a scroll style to the html in css, and also that adding the scrolling functionality of the page works better if you do it in JavaScript. I'll redo some of the my major projects to include the stuff that I have learnt while building this project.

### Day 70: July 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Javascript Tutorial: Countdown Timer
(https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/hone-your-javascript-skills-by-building-these-15-projects/)

**Thoughts** I built a countdown timer... and it's realtime!!! I love it, I enjoyed this project. I think it's projects like this that make me really excited about learning javascript.

### Day 71: July 31, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Javascript Tutorial: Memory Game
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNdUVh3qCc)

**Thoughts** I built the memory game. It was kinda fun playing something that I had created. The code is heavily reliant on JavaScript, I didn't do much CSS, but I will add some to the code to make it look more better.

### Day 72: August 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: HTML & CSS: Responsive Web Design

**Thoughts** I am reading the book "Beginning Responsive Web Design with HTML5 and CSS3" by Jonathan Fielding, partly because making my websites and webpages responsive has been an uphill battle for me. I'll apply the nuggets I learn to the websites I have already created to make them more responsive.

**Thoughts** I keep getting a type error of null on line 186 and 185. I have gone over my code, compared it with the source code but I can't seem to spot the problem. I'll go through it tomorrow just to go over it gain with fresh eyes. But after publishing it on Netlify, the error does not appear.

**Today's Progress**: Javascript Tutorial: To Do List
(https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/hone-your-javascript-skills-by-building-these-15-projects/); Responsive Design Redo (Tolkien Tribute)

**Thoughts** When I kept getting a type error of null on line 186 and 185, I decided to go over the code again today. I can't seem to see why I would get getting the null type error. However, after publishing the project on Netlify, the error does not appear. This was quite wierd and frustrating!

The book on responsive web design that I have been reading the past couple of days has made it easier for me to understand media queries which had been giving me a hard time for a while ("Beginning Responsive Web Design with HTML5 and CSS3" by Jonathan Fielding). I have redone the tolkien tribute page to be responsive.

### Day 76: August 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Book: "Beginning Responsive Web Design with HTML5 and CSS3" by Jonathan Fielding.

**Thoughts** I have finished reading this book. I have redone some of my former websites to showcase what I have learnt from this book. Media queries and the subject of responsiveness now doesn't seem such a hassle, the book was quite helpful. It's a book that I plan to keep on referring to every now and then, so as to get better and better in building responsive web pages and websites.

### Day 77: August 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript Coding Challenges : Edabit (https://edabit.com)

**Thoughts** I have stopped doing javascript tutorials. They really helped in making me get comfortable with javascript syntax, but now, it's time to take a dive without them. The coding challenges on Edabit are fine, I've tackled functions that deal with addition, subtraction, multiplication, arrays.
