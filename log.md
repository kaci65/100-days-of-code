# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created a product landing page in CSS and HTML, worked on functionality for the page (not aesthetics lol).

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS. Getting stuff to look aesthetically pleasing is difficult for me, but I managed to figure out how some stuff work.

### Day 2: May 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Tried to finish up on the product landing page, the CSS part. It's not coming out properly but I won't waste too much time on it or I might get stuck here.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS for the landing page, but, slowly, I will get better at it.

### Day 3: May 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I have completed the tribute page.

**Thoughts** I have completed the tribute page but I have failed to pass all the checks required by FCC.

### Day 4: May 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I started on the personal portfolio page today, I'm struggling massively on the CSS part though.

**Thoughts** I feel kinda down that I am still stuggling with CSS. I had to redo my project like three times, from scratch mind you.

### Day 5: May 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I'm still struggling with the personal portfolio page, moreso with the CSS bit.

**Thoughts** I hope that I'll start getting this CSS stuff sooner. I decided to make a bet with my brother today: if I have not mastered how to do basic website designing by next week Wednesday, I'll owe him $50. I need all the motivation I can get right now.

### Day 6: May 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I completed a test website, to train myself more in html and css

**Thoughts** I created for pages that you can navigate to: home, about, services and contacts. I did different styling not only to the text but also to the divs (different sections of the page). It's more of a rough work but I'm proud of the work I accomplished today. I also learn how to host on netlify.

### Day 7: May 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I decided to gett the book, Get Coding by Young Rewired State.

**Thoughts** I have managed to do a bit today in going through the book and creating dummy pages as per the exercises of the book.

### Day 8: May 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I added more css to my page, though I did not get to where I was hoping to be at the end of the day.

**Thoughts** I revisited the product landing page that was giving me a hard tie last week. I started afresh, I'm not done yet with it.

### Day 9: May 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I decided to take time off today from my projects, and instead create fun stuff with html and css

**Thoughts** I created some animation with css and html but more of css than html, a running man with a complete background image and moving motions of the running man. Taking a break from my projects was just what I needed to decompress and reset my mind.

### Day 10: May 31, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I had laptop issues today, I couldn't manage to code.

**Thoughts** I skipped a day today, I hope this doesn't happen again

### Day 11: June 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I have managed to get my product landing page to where I would like it to be at the moment (I redid everything, with the new html and css having a name of home).

**Thoughts** The progress of the product landing page has gone well today, though the navbar had given me some problems earlier in the day.

### Day 12: June 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I have managed to create a technical documentation page.

**Thoughts** The @media styling part of css is kinda confusing to me, but without it my page looks kinda funny. I'll try to figure it out though and try and understand it better.

### Day 13: June 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I created a flip card today.

**Thoughts** Using CSS to make the motions of flipping a card happen was interesting. I chose this project because I want to get good at css.

### Day 14: June 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I decided to recreate the conquer website: https://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page196/conquer.

**Thoughts** Today was interesting majorly because the challenge is to use no bootstrap to remake the above website but still make it responsive. I've been all over the place, googling, stack overflow, w3 schools, treehouse... basically everywhere. It took me long time to get the navbar to even look as it does right now, but the height still doesn't look good. This is hard work, but rewarding at the same time.

### Day 15: June 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I'm continuing where I left off yesterday, remake of the conquer website: https://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page196/conquer.

**Thoughts** I code my code lines tangled and I'm upto my neck trying to untangle everything. This sure is a lesson learnt, to be neat and organised from the word go. It will sure save me grief in the future! Now back to untangling lol

### Day 16: June 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I am done with the remake of the conquer website: https://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page196/conquer.

**Thoughts** I feel like moonwalking... maybe I will after typinh this! The website has come out looking good, no bootstrap or JS has been used,just HTML and CSS. I'm proud of the work I have accomplished today, yay!!! The responsiveness is not 100% percent there though lol. Oh, and btw, I managed to organise my code, it looks more neat now.

### Day 17: June 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I have completed Mission 2: Create a Password from the book Get Coding by Young Rewired State (https://www.amazon.com/Get-Coding-Learn-JavaScript-Website/dp/076369276X/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=get+coding&qid=1591559697&s=books&sr=1-1)

**Thoughts** I had started doing some javascript about 2 months ago, but a month into it, I wasn't getting a lot of the stuff. But the notes I have gone through today plus the exercises (from the book) are simplified and easier for me to understand. Today, I have learnt about creating a password page, which is linked it to another page. Having the password verified using javascript will determine whether you can access the linked page or not.

### Day 18: June 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I decided to revisit Flexbox and CSS Grid today

**Thoughts** I noticed that I did not have a good understanding of these two, I eben rarely used them in my code, which meant that I wrote more lines than I needed to and my work ends up looking complicated. I sometimes have no idea what line does what when I look at it. Using Flexbox and CSS Grid will sure be of much help to me and my lines!

### Day 19: June 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I have managed to only write 5 lines of code on my porfolio page project

**Thoughts** I've been researching the "perfect layout and BG image" for my portfolio page, since 2pm. Nine and a half hours later, I have 20 tabs open and only 5 lines of code 😂😂😂. I tend to overthink stuff but today was on another level. I

### Day 20: June 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I redid the tribute page

**Thoughts** Although I had earlier done the tribute page (on day 3 of the challenge), it was not up to par with the FCC checklist. I decided to redo it because I want to feature some of my projects on the portfolio page that I am yet to build. I based the tribute on JRR Tolkien, I love his books!

### Day 21: June 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Survey Form (just the HTML)

**Thoughts**I chose to redo the survey form I did one and a half years ago, for the FCC curriculum. The progress has been slow but I have managed to finish the html side of things.

### Day 22: June 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Survey Form (just the HTML & CSS)

**Thoughts** The CSS bit was kinda challenging but I have managed to finish this project. I'm slowly but steadily improving on the CSS bit. For a minute, I got tempted to follow a youtube tutorial, but I'm glad I didn't. I've learnt a lot today, on the coding part but also about myself. That if I just hang in there, I can do it!

### Day 23: June 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: CSS Exercises from w3schools

**Thoughts** I felt like doing exercises today to help me continue to improve in my css. It's quite amazing how much I have retained without knowing it since I started building and creating projects, and I'm glad to see that I can solve most of the exercises without requiring to do any research (google) or ask someone.

### Day 25: June 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Redoing the product landing page.

**Thoughts** The previous product landing page that I created on day one, does not pass FCC muster, so I've had to redo it. Today I have laid down the pages barebones, that is HTML. I'll start on the CSS bit tomorrow.

### Day 32: June 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started building the personal portfolio page.

**Thoughts** I kinda struggled with the css bit, to get it to look the way I wanted. I'll call it quits for today and tackle this tomorrow, with a fresh mind. I hosted it on netlify.

### Day 33: June 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished building the personal portfolio page.

**Thoughts** Tackling this with a fresh mind sure helped a lot! Though I am still kinda struggling with the media queries, css flexbox and grid. I decided not to use a background image in this project and I like how it looks. I have also re-edited the navbar from the product-landing-page folder, both in html and css, but the header area is still too big for me.

### Day 34: June 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Had a hard time with CSS (replicating the four card feature from), didn't finish project.

**Thoughts** Today has been kinda frustrating, one step forward two steps back! I'm trying to recreate this https://frontendmentor.io/challenges/four-card-feature-section-weK1eFYK instead I've managed to do this https://github.com/kaci65/projects-100-days-of-code/tree/master/four-card-feature instead.

### Day 35: June 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Working on recreating the google page.

**Thoughts** I'm stuck on the font awesome icons. They refuse to work, but I managed to finish the HTML part.

### Day 36: June 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished the google page

**Thoughts** The page closely resembles the google one but not all the way. Getting the search button to fit nicely in the search box was a nightmare. It took me over an hour to get it to work (50%). I tried following some tutorials to create this part but for some reason they made my code look worse. I'm getting a little frustrated with CSS, I should get it by now.

### Day 38: June 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Parallax page

**Thoughts** I couldn't get the parallax effect to work!  I think I messed up my h1 headings code too, because I have to add display:absolute to get them to stay at their respective positions. I'll just leave the code as it is today because earlier on I messed my code up and I had to undo a lot of stuff. I'll look at it with fresh eyes tomorrow.

### Day 39: June 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Parallax page

**Thoughts** I tried to troubleshoot my code from yesterday but it seemed like I made everything worse with every code revision I made. I took a break from it then decided to start a fresh. This time round, I added the images through css instead of html and it made my work a little easier. The parallax effect works! *happy jig!!!*
