**Today's Progress**: Created a product landing page in CSS and HTML, worked on functionality for the page (not aesthetics lol).

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS. Getting stuff to look aesthetically pleasing is difficult for me, but I managed to figure out how some stuff work.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
